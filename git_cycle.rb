#Instructions: Switch off between partners.
#Do the exercise and uncomment the appropriate 
#line of driver code.
#After the driver code has passed,
#1) add the file
#2) commit it
#3) pull
#4) push it


#Exercise 1

def add(n1, n2)
  n1 + n2
end

#Exercise 2

# def subtract(n1, n2)
#     n1  n2 #fix me!!
#   #fix the block of code to return the difference 
#   #of 2 numbers then delete these comments
# end

#Exercise 3

# def multiply(n1, n2)
#   return n3 
#   #write a block of code to return the product 
#   #of 2 numbers then delete these comments
# end

#Exercise 4

# def divide(n1, n2)
#   return n1/n2
#   #make necessary corrections then delete these comments
# end
